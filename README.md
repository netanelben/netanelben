Hello GitHub! 👋😄 I'm Nate, a front-end developer with a passion for UX/UI design and a keen eye for details. 🌟 When I'm not coding, you can find me composing and producing electronic music 🎵, curating and crafting digital art 🎨, or shredding it on a skateboard 🛹. I'm also a big fan of theater 🎭 and films 🎥. 

Oh, and I'm a proud parent of two adorable cats! 🐱🐱😻 #CatLover 🐾💕
